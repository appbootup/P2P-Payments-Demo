# Elix Smart Contract Demos
Prerequisites: Ethereum testnet and browser developer console.

In order to simulate interactions on our lending and crowdfunding platforms, please select either the "Lending" or "Crowdfunding" folder above, and then download the different scenarios from the "Scenarios" folder. You will need to have an Ethereum testnet server such as TestRPC working in order to run the scenarios.
